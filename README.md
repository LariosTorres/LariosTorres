# Hi, Iâ€™m Jose de Jesus Larios Torres
## I'm a Sofware Engineer
I am passionate about programming, from something as simple as Excel formulas, to the most difficult things like cybersecurity or artificial intelligence.

I've learned a bit of everything, SQL, Java, C#, C++, .Net, everything fascinated me, but there was one set that I loved, web development.
I have spent several days of my life writing, correcting and polishing my own projects, all of them already lost for the simple fact of not having known Git and Github before, so here I am, starting once again and now yes, hoping that everything that make it reflected in this profile.
